/**
 * google-gax exports createApiCall, a transform on a function that accepts an
 * argument and callback (representing arbitrary asynchronous work), as well as
 * metadata and call options (details specific to gRPC). Internally, it does the
 * necessary work to generate metadata and call options for each call to this
 * function, as well as scheduling retries, etc. so that the caller doesn't
 * have to be concerned with these details. The returned, transformed function
 * has a different call signature as a result.
 *
 * There is a caveat to the above -- the input is not the pre-transformed
 * function itself, but rather a *Promise* that will resolve to that function.
 *
 * Because every call of the transformed function must defer the actual
 * asynchronous work until the above mentioned Promise has been resolved,
 * createApiCall presents a possible source of context loss. The test in this
 * file ensures that spans corresponding to that asynchronous work and spans
 * created in its callback are created with the correct root span context, which
 * is the context in which the transformed function is called, *not* the context
 * in which createApiCall was called.
